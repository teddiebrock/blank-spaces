*"Make kin, not babies"*
*- Donna Haraway*

&nbsp;

**Eco / Xeno is an 'anti-lifestyle lifestyle blog' about sustainability and daily resistance.**



This small seed of a blog was planted to grow space (and flourish alongside countless others) to explore alternative futures for human/non-human life centered around justice, resilience, maintenance, and repair.

I aim to enmesh theory, observations, and wanderings from daily life with opportunities for radical collective action and unlikely kinships.

helpful tutorials by the [Programming Historian](https://programminghistorian.org/).
