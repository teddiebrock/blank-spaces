*"Make kin, not babies"*
*- Donna Haraway*

&nbsp;

**Eco / Xeno is an 'anti-lifestyle' lifestyle blog about sustainability and everyday resistance.**



This blog was planted to grow space for alternative futures centered around social justice, resilience, maintenance, and repair.

I aim to combine theory, musings, and wanderings with concrete opportunities for radical action and building unexpected kinships.

helpful tutorials by the [Programming Historian](https://programminghistorian.org/).
