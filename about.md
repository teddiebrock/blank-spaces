*"Make kin, not babies"*
*- Donna Haraway*

**Eco / Xeno is an 'anti-lifestyle lifestyle blog' about sustainability and daily resistance.**



This tiny seed of a blog was planted to grow space (and flourish with countless others) to explore alternative futures for human/non/in-human life based on principles of justice, resilience, maintenance, and repair.

I hope to mix theory, observation, and wanderings from daily life with opportunities for radical collective action in service of growing something better -- together.
