# {{ page.title }}

I am a researcher whose interests span across culture, activism, art, design, and curation.
<br><br>In 2017 I graduated with a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Victoria in English Literature with a focus on media studies and digital humanities.<br><br>My work engages with questions around social justice, affect, and embodiment as they relate to community, arts, and knowledge practices.
<br>

With my background in business systems analysis, I have also developed resources for teaching software and digital skills such as document control and project management in the workplace.

More broadly, I am curious about how social systems and institutional cultures work in relation to our experiences of media spaces and art-worlds.<br><br>
