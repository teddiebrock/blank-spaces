**In Situ is an 'anti-lifestyle' lifestyle blog about sustainability and everyday resistance.**



It was planted to grow space for exploring futures centered around social justice, resilience, maintenance, and repair.

I see it as a cross between a research log and personal scrapbook. I aim to mix theory, musings, and wanderings with concrete opportunities for radical action and building unexpected kinships.

helpful tutorials by the [Programming Historian](https://programminghistorian.org/).
