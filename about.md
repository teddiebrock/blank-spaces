*How should one be positioned in order to see, in this situation of tensions, resonances, transformations, resistances, and complicities? - Donna Haraway*

My name is Teddie Brock. This blog is a cross between a personal research log and scrapbook to help me think / work through trouble. It is a space for thinking about the present ('in situ') in order to imagine futures centering sustainability, community resilience, maintenance, and repair. From a non-expert perspective I'll blend theory, musings, and wanderings with concrete opportunities for radical action and building unexpected kinships.
