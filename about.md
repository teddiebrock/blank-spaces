*"Make kin, not babies"*
*- Donna Haraway*

**Eco / Xeno is an 'anti-lifestyle lifestyle blog' about sustainability and daily resistance.**



This tiny seed of a blog was planted to grow space (and flourish with countless others) to explore alternative futures for human/non/in-human life based on principles of justice, resilience, maintenance, and repair.

As a life project, I hope to blend theory, observations, musings, and wanderings with opportunities for concrete radical action against unjust systems in service of growing something better -- together.
