*<center>How should one be positioned in order to see, in this situation of tensions, resonances, <br>transformations, resistances, and complicities?
<br>-Donna Haraway</center>*

My name is Teddie Brock. This site is a cross between a research log and personal scrapbook to help me work / think through trouble. It's a space for thinking about the present, 'in place,' and for imagining futures that center resilience, care, and repair. <br>
<br>From a non-expert perspective I'll blend theory, musings, and wanderings with concrete opportunities for radical action and unexpected kinships.

helpful tutorials by the [Programming Historian](https://programminghistorian.org/).
