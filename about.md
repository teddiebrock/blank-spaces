I'm a Canadian (Vancouver, BC) living in London, UK.

In 2017 I graduated with a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Victoria in English Literature with a focus on media studies (film + sound) and the digital humanities (maker-spaces). I am interested in exploring, designing, and building equitable futures.

helpful tutorials by the [Programming Historian](https://programminghistorian.org/).
