*"Make kin, not babies"*
*- Donna Haraway*

**Eco / Xeno is an 'anti-lifestyle lifestyle blog' about sustainability and daily resistance.**



This small seed of a blog was planted to grow space (and flourish among countless others) to explore alternative futures for human/non/in-human life founded on the principles of social justice, resilience, maintenance, and repair.

As an ongoing personal project, I aim to enmesh theory, observations, musings, and wanderings from daily life with opportunities for radical collective action and unlikely kinships.
