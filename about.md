# {{ page.title }}

I am a writer and researcher whose interests span across culture, activism, art, design, and curation. I am currently based in the Vancouver region (Canada), but will soon be relocating to London, UK (August 2018)
<br><br>In 2017 I graduated with a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Victoria in English Literature with a focus on media studies and digital humanities.<br><br>My work engages with questions around social justice, affect, and embodiment as they relate to various arts and knowledge practices.
<br>

With my background in business systems analysis, I have also developed resources for teaching software and digital skills such as document control and project management in the workplace.

In general, I am curious about how social systems and institutions work in relation to how we both build and navigate our various media spaces and art-worlds. <br><br>
