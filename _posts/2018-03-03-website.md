With little familiarity with code or web-development (on both technical and cultural levels), I decided I wanted to explore the current state/trends of web development as a community and industry. This tiny [static website](https://www.chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/jekyll1/60913){:target="_blank"} is the result of that initial process. It was made using Jekyll, a static site generator and hosted on GitHub pages.

In the future, I plan to incorporate a simple search tool called [Lunr](https://lunrjs.com/) into this page. I will also provide an outline of web tools/approaches I tried & why I picked this method over other (presumably easier) options for setting up my first personal website.
