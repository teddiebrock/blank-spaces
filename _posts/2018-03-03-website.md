With little familiarity with code (on both technical and cultural leves), I decided I wanted to explore the current state of web development as a community and industry. This tiny [static website](https://www.chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/jekyll1/60913){:target="_blank"} is a side-result of that process. It was made using Jekyll, a static site generator and hosted on GitHub pages.

In the future, I plan to incorporate a simple search tool called [Lunr](https://lunrjs.com/) into this page. I will also provide an outline of web tools/approaches I tried & why I picked this method over other (presumably easier) options for setting up a personal website.
