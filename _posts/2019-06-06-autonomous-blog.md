title: "the autonomous blog"
---

It’s hard to imagine an internet where we have collective, transparent control over how (and why) we publish our work -- or simply exist -- in digital spaces. Today, it is [almost impossible](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/17/almost-impossible-to-function-without-big-five-tech-giants) to escape the surveillance architecture of Big Tech companies. This is not to say that our our lives are not sometimes made easier by using these products, but that there are significant costs to the methods by which tech companies relate to the public as part of [extractive, exploitative, and resource-intensive](https://anatomyof.ai/) business models. One such result is that such companies must invest heavily in the public's ongoing participation in services for their own sake rather then for a clearly defined purpose that respects our boundaries (e.g. to learn something new, to socialize, to build community across different locations, to organize politically) — and in ways that are typically [unsustainable for ourselves and the planet](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jul/17/internet-climate-carbon-footprint-data-centres).

For these reasons, I was curious about what an ‘autonomous’ internet would look like. What are some ways we could ‘home-grow’ our own digital space? What tools are available to those of us who want to publish something we make without bowing down to the anxious logic of social metrics and surveillance? Can the internet ever be ‘slow’ rather than constantly in (what feels to be) a state of acceleration? Can more publishing online exist more than just as ephemeral clickbait ‘content’ for algorithmic newsfeeds?

Personally, I’m not interested in reverting to a nostalgic ideal of what the internet ‘used to be.’ Instead, I’m curious about what kinds of everyday practices someone with little technical knowledge might engage in to push back against (or in particular, to build in *contrast* to) a heavily commercialized digital environment. For myself, one possibility was to figure out a way to start my own website without outsourcing my content, maintenance, or design entirely to private website solution services or social publishing platforms such as Squarespace or Medium

### Build A Blog Yourself (or B.A.B.Y)

For about 10 years now I’ve been interested in DIY culture. In the spirit of zine-making, I wondered if there existed a tool for digital self-publishing equivalent to using an old copier and a stapler. I was curious, too, about how using such tools could loosely structure my desire to publish work free from capitalist-careerist incentives, in the midst of an oversaturated marketplace of ad-fuelled freelancers.

I knew I didn't want to rely on external software and corporate services if possible, but with keeping energy efficiency, adaptability (durability), and privacy in mind. In the end, I settled on using a "static site generator" called [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). <br>My decision was also largely inspired by an approach called  [“minimal computing.”](https://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/about/)
>>Minimal computing *“refers to computing done under some set of significant constraints of hardware, software, education, network capacity, power, or other factors.”*

>>Some core tenets of minimal computing might include: **minimal surveillance, minimal interface, minimal consumption, minimal dependencies, and minimal maintenance**

>>It can also be understood as a call for a kind of *“critical movement, akin to environmentalism, asking for balance between gains and costs in related areas that include social justice issues and de-manufacturing and reuse.”*  

In a basic sense, by deconstructing the process of building a website to determine what is/isn't needed to serve my purposes, I’ve done away with bulky interfaces for editing and managing my content, which are common in most social blogging platforms; instead, I'm left with a folder of lightweight text files that I update directly from inside my text editor. What I've gained is perhaps a slightly better understanding of the various components/architectures required to publish online. (What can I do myself vs. what I depend on others to do for me.)

A less immediate benefit of learning alternative ways to publish online might be to reclaim agency in an environment increasingly designed to commodify our work and/or activity. For myself, I was desperate for a more tangible way to make space in an ‘always-online’ culture, where streaming large quantities of data on a constant basis is also the norm (and assumes we live in a world of infinite resources). Although using Jekyll is not a solution to the massive influence and power of the corporate internet, knowing that it’s possible to use the command line and a simple text editor to structure and manage my own website is rewarding — especially being someone not inclined towards technical work with computers. I guess in a small way, it allowed me explore what a hypothetical autonomous internet might require of average people, as well as the limits of individual web-making. Running my own static site, if anything, also means I don’t have to worry if my Squarespace subscription expires or if Medium starts going in a [questionable direction](http://studyhall.xyz/blog/2018/6/12/mediums-mess-the-rise-and-fall-of-the-site-that-was-supposed-to-save-journalism).

That being said, I don't want to misrepresent the time and effort it takes to survey one's mainstream options and then learn another, much less common way of doings things. There's a learning curve to using Jekyll, and most have us have to overcome a deeply ingrained resistance to using the command line (which I definitely had!). At the same time, running a static site is a relatively shallow / non-technical process compared to learning how to actually program, for example.

I also know it's easy to argue that this approach has significant downsides: there is obviously much less chance for these words to ever go viral, or be of any value to the attention economy at large. But this pervasive logic is one reason why I started this project in the first place — to imagine for myself what it means to resist exploitative quantitative metrics for determining what’s ‘valuable’ and what isn’t.
