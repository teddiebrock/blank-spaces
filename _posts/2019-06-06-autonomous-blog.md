title: "the autonomous blog"
---

It’s hard to imagine an internet where we have full control over how (and why) we publish our work. It is [almost impossible](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/17/almost-impossible-to-function-without-big-five-tech-giants) today to escape the imposing architecture of Big Tech platforms. Over time, these services have been optimized to extract maximum profit from our digital activity, and often with significant [environmental impacts](https://gizmodo.com/amazon-is-aggressively-pursuing-big-oil-as-it-stalls-ou-1833875828). As part of their extractive business models, the rights and boundaries of individual users and those communities embedded within the architecture of social platforms are at constant risk of being exploited. It makes sense, then, that these companies are increasingly invested in making us feel the need to participate in services for their own sake rather then for a clear purpose (e.g. to learn something new, to socialize, to build community, to organize politically) — and in ways that are unsustainable for ourselves and the planet.

For these reasons, I was curious about what an ‘autonomous’ internet would look like. What are some ways we could ‘home-grow’ our own digital space? What tools are available to those of us who want to publish something we make without bowing down to the anxious logic of social metrics? Can the internet ever be ‘slow’ rather than constantly in (what feels to be) a state of acceleration? Can more publishing online exist more than just as ephemeral clickbait ‘content’ for algorithmic newsfeeds?

I’m not interested in reverting to a nostalgic ideal of what the internet ‘used to be.’ Instead, I’m curious about what kinds of everyday practices someone with little technical knowledge might engage in to push back against (or in particular, to build in *contrast* to) a heavily commercialized digital environment. For myself, one possibility was to try running my own static website.

### Build A Blog Yourself (or B.A.B.Y)

For about 10 years now I’ve been interested in DIY punk/zine culture. So I wondered if there could be an equivalent to digital self-publishing today with little more than an old black and white copier and a stapler. In the spirit of zine-making, I wondered too if I could explicitly publish my work without careerist or capitalist gain in a oversaturated marketplace of influencers.

 My decision to use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) (and what is called a “static site generator”) was also in large part informed by a conceptual approach to technology called  [“minimal computing.”](https://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/about/) Minimal computing *“refers to computing done under some set of significant constraints of hardware, software, education, network capacity, power, or other factors.”* It can also be understood as a call for a kind of *“critical movement, akin to environmentalism, asking for balance between gains and costs in related areas that include social justice issues and de-manufacturing and reuse.”* With my own site, I wanted to reduce my reliance on external software and corporate services as much as possible, with energy efficiency, adaptability, and privacy in mind. By going this route, I’ve done away with bulky interfaces for editing and managing my content, which are common in most social blogging platforms; instead, I'm left with a folder of lightweight text files that I update directly from inside my text editor.

For myself, the biggest benefit of learning alternative ways to publish online comes down to reclaiming agency in an environment increasingly designed to commodify our work. I also wanted a tangible way to make space for myself in an ‘always-online’ culture and constant streaming of large quantities of data. Although using Jekyll is not a solution to these larger problems around the corporate internet, knowing that it’s possible to use the command line and a simple text editor to structure and manage my own website is rewarding — especially as someone who is not inclined towards the more technical aspects of computing. In a practical sense, it also means I don’t have to worry if my Squarespace subscription expires or if Medium starts going in a [questionable direction](http://studyhall.xyz/blog/2018/6/12/mediums-mess-the-rise-and-fall-of-the-site-that-was-supposed-to-save-journalism). (Although unfortunately, GitHub -- the repository where I 'push' my text-files -- is now owned by Microsoft).

That being said, I also don't want to misrepresent the time and effort it takes to survey one's mainstream options and then learn another, much less common way of doings things. It's an ongoing, imperfect process with various barriers to entry, depending on where you start.

I know it can easily be argued that an overwhelming downside to such an approach is less opportunity for attention to flow over these words. But this pervasive logic is in large part why I created this project in the first place — to resist exploitative business models and quantitative metrics for determining what’s ‘valuable’ and what isn’t.
