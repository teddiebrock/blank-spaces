title: "the autonomous blog"

It’s hard to imagine an internet where we have collective, transparent control over how (and why) we publish our work -- or simply exist -- in digital spaces. Frustratingly, it is [almost impossible](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/17/almost-impossible-to-function-without-big-five-tech-giants) to escape the surveillance architecture of Big Tech companies. This isn't to say that our our lives aren't sometimes made easier by using these products, but that there are significant costs to the methods by which tech companies relate to the public as part of [extractive, exploitative, and resource-intensive](https://anatomyof.ai/) business models. These companies must continually invest in the public's participation in services for their own sake -- and in ways that are typically [unsustainable for ourselves and the planet](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jul/17/internet-climate-carbon-footprint-data-centres) -- rather then for a clearly defined purpose that respects our boundaries and serves the common good (e.g. to learn something new, to socialize, to build community across different locations, to organize politically).

Out of this climate, I was curious about what an ‘autonomous’ internet would look like. What are some ways we could 'grow' our own digital space? What tools are available to those of us who want to publish something we make without bowing down to the anxious logic of social metrics and surveillance? Can the internet ever be ‘slow’ rather than constantly in (what feels to be) a state of acceleration? Can more publishing online exist more than just as ephemeral clickbait ‘content’ for algorithmic newsfeeds?

I’m personally not interested in reverting to a nostalgic ideal of what the internet ‘used to be.’ But I’m curious about what kinds of things someone with little to no technical knowledge might do or learn to push back against (or to build in *contrast* to) a heavily commercialized digital environment. For myself, one avenue was to figure out how to start my own website. But I would try to do it *without* outsourcing my content, maintenance, or design to private 'all-in-one' website solutions or social publishing platforms such as Squarespace or Medium

### Build A Blog Yourself (B.A.B.Y)

For about 10 years now I’ve been interested in DIY culture. In the spirit of zine-making, I wondered if there could be a tool for digital self-publishing equivalent to using an old copier and a stapler. I was curious, too, about how using these tools could loosely structure my desire to publish work free from more 'capitalist/careerist' incentives -- especially in the midst of an oversaturated marketplace of freelancers and influencers.

I knew I didn't want to rely on bulky external software and corporate services if possible, but instead keep energy efficiency, adaptability (durability), as well as privacy in mind. In the end, I settled on using a "static site generator" called [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

My decision was also largely inspired by an approach called  [“minimal computing.”](https://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/about/)
>>Minimal computing *“refers to computing done under some set of significant constraints of hardware, software, education, network capacity, power, or other factors.”*

>>Some core tenets of minimal computing might include: **minimal surveillance, minimal interface, minimal consumption, minimal dependencies, and minimal maintenance**

>>It can also be understood as a call for a kind of *“critical movement, akin to environmentalism, asking for balance between gains and costs in related areas that include social justice issues and de-manufacturing and reuse.”*  

By deconstructing the process of building a website to figure out what I did or didn't need to serve my purposes, I’ve done away with bulky interfaces for editing and managing my content (which are common in most social platforms). Instead I'm left with a folder of lightweight text files that I update directly from inside my text editor. What I've gained is, perhaps, a slightly better understanding of the various components/architectures required to publish online. (What can I do myself vs. what I depend on others to do for me.)

Another benefit of using alternative ways to publish online might be to reclaim agency in an environment increasingly designed to commodify our work and/or activity. For myself, I was desperate for a more tangible way to make space in an ‘always-online’ culture, where streaming large quantities of data on a constant basis is also the norm (and assumes we live in a world of infinite resources). Although using Jekyll is not a solution to the massive influence and power of the corporate internet, knowing that it’s possible to use the command line and a simple text editor to structure and manage my own website is rewarding — especially as someone who's not necessarily that technically inclined. I guess in a small way, it helped me explore what a hypothetical autonomous internet might require of average people, as well as the limits of individual web-making. Running my own static site, if anything, also means I don’t have to worry if my Squarespace subscription expires or if Medium starts going in a [questionable direction](http://studyhall.xyz/blog/2018/6/12/mediums-mess-the-rise-and-fall-of-the-site-that-was-supposed-to-save-journalism).

But I also don't want to misrepresent the time and effort it takes to survey the most popular options and then learn another, less common way of doings things. At the same time, running a static site is a relatively shallow / non-technical process compared to learning how to, say, actually program. And though it's great for myself as a single person, it would be limiting to work with on a collaborative, larger scale.

I also know it's easy to argue the glaring downsides of this approach: for one, there's much less chance for these words to be read widely, if at all, and therefore they're practically worthless in the eyes of the 'attention economy.' But this pervasive logic is one reason why I started this project in the first place — to imagine for myself what it means to resist exploitative quantitative metrics for determining what’s ‘valuable’ and what isn’t.
