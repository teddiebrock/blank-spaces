# info
<br>
I'm a Canadian (Vancouver, BC) living in London, UK.
<br>
<br>In 2017 I graduated with a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Victoria in English Literature with a focus on media studies and digital humanities.

I care a lot about community, art, and social justice & how these things come together.<br>
<br>

( * ) I made this tiny webspace with GitHub Pages & Jekyll using <br>helpful tutorials by the [Programming Historian](https://programminghistorian.org/).
