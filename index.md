# about

I am a West Coast Canadian living in London, UK.
<br>
<br>In 2017 I graduated with a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Victoria in English Literature with a focus on media studies and digital humanities. I care a lot about community, art, and social justice & how to bring those things together.<br>
<br>
( * ) I made this tiny webspace using <br>helpful tutorials by the [Programming Historian](https://programminghistorian.org/).
