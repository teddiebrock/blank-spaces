# info
<br>
I'm a Canadian (Vancouver, BC) living in London, UK.
<br>
<br>In 2017 I graduated with a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Victoria in English Literature with a focus on media studies (film + sound) and the digital humanities (maker-spaces).

I am interested in exploring, designing, and building equitable futures from an arts and humanities perspective.<br>
